## Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

## About me
Hi there! My name is Michael Sidwell and I have recently embarked on a new adventure into the world of Software Engineering. Having previously trained as a Chartered Accountant at ICAEW, I have 6 years of working experience within the world of auditing, senior financial business partnering and external reporting - including working for two years at the Royal Household within Buckingham Palace, London! I am excited to start this new journey, and hope that you will find my work to be of interest.
